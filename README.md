## Architecture

```
Hygraph (headless CMS)  →  GraphQL API  →  React frontends
```

## Monorepo Structure

```
apps/
  public-site/    — Public React SPA (P2: Anthony)
  locked-area/    — Locked Metodmaterial React SPA (P4: Mohand)
packages/
  shared-types/   — Shared TypeScript types (auto-generated from Hygraph)

```

## Team

| Role | Person | Responsibility |
|------|--------|----------------|
| P2 | Anthony Foran | Public React frontend, all pages, SEO, accessibility |

| P4 | Mohand | Locked area, Metodmaterial, CI/CD, deployment |

## Branch Strategy

- `main` — protected, requires PR review
- `develop` — integration branch
- `feature/pX-description` — individual feature branches

## PR Rules

- Every merge to `main` requires 1 approved review
- Review your own domain last — fresh eyes catch more
- Cross-cutting changes (shared-types, CI/CD) → Team Leader reviews
